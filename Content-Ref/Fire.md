CORE INNOVATIONS & RESEARCH
The Nalanda Architecture (NLDA) & CausalBrain Engine
Architected a hybrid, AGI-like system that grounds knowledge in a
rule-based, causal model of the world, rejecting correlational
approaches.
Powered by a `CausalBrain` engine that uses AdaptF for hybrid
retrieval (Semantic + BM25) to extract causal relationships from text.
Quantum Causal Intelligence Architecture (QCIA)
Invented a patented system for autonomous agents to discover
causal relationships through direct experience, without pre-trained
data.
Causal relationships are mapped into a `networkx` graph and a lowdimensional geometric manifold discovered using `Isomap`, enabling
logical pathnding.
Adaptive Fourier Attention (AdaptF)
Engineered a near-linear time O(n log n) attention analogue that
enables true global context understanding of arbitrarily long
documents (~300,000 tokens) on consumer-grade hardware.
Harmonic Resonance Framework (HRF) - Spectral PDE
Solver
Invented an advanced spectral method for solving PDEs using the
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) with adaptive coefcient ltering.
In software simulations, achieved a 100-146x speedup and 64-114x
memory reduction over traditional methods.
Published Research: 3D Navier-Stokes Equations
Developed an AI-guided framework using an evolutionary algorithm
to discover a candidate singularity for this Clay Millennium Prize
problem.
Rigorously validated the candidate through resolution convergence
up to 512³, viscosity scaling analysis, and quantitative proof of selfsimilar collapse. (Status: Submitted to PNAS)

(HRF)
Applying NLDA to Cancer Vaccine Design (Nalandium)
Co-founding "Nalandium," a for-prot services company, through an
MOU with a UK-based biotech consultant to commercialize a novel
cancer vaccine pipeline.
Architecting a domain-specic workow on the NLDA platform for
neoantigen discovery, integrating scRNA-seq data, molecular docking,
and immune simulation.
Applying Causal AIto Urban Analytics (UrbanForgeAI)
Delivered a successful Proof of Concept for Genesys Int'l, creating
an advanced urban analytics platform with 3D visualization and NLP
capabilities under NDA.
Achieved an ~20x acceleration in development, delivering the entire
system in just 3 days versus the 7-10 week industry standard.
Applying QCIA to Quantum Error Correction (QEC)
Developed a simulation framework where an autonomous AI agent
discovers quantum error correction codes through iterative
experimentation and causal reasoning.
Integrated QCIA to build a causal model of quantum noise, enabling
the agent to propose and rene correction strategies.
Implemented a Streamlit-based UI for real-time visualization of the
agent's mind map and discovery process.
